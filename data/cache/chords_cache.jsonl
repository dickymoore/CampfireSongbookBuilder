{"artist": "The Smiths", "title": "I Don't Owe You Anything", "chords": "\n \"(1)\n THIS ISN�??T MINE ITS FROM\n Smithsguitar.com\n I don�??t owe you anything TAB\n Hello!\n As requested earlier on this list, here's the complete guitar tab for \"I\n don't owe you anything\". I hope I got it all right cuz I didn't check with\n the recording, only with my guitar.\n The song is in E, but you play it in actual D with your guitar tuned up 2\n half steps (or capo up 2 frets). The verse riff is classic Marr stuff with\n lots of open strings and slides and those typical maj7 chords. Try to let\n single notes ring as long as possible.\n The barre chords (Cmaj7, Dmaj7, A) must be played accentuated with right and\n left hand damping (using upstrokes). Listen to the album version to get the timing right.\n Notes in parentheses mean that I don't really hear them on the record but\n play them anyway, esp when there's no bass playing along.\n As for the song order, you've got to find that out by yourself. :)))\n Comments and corrections are welcome.\n Enjoy!\n Genghiz\n I DON'T OWE YOU ANYTHING (from �??The Smiths�??)\n INTRO:\n [Cmaj7]  [A6]

Add\n this at the ends of lines (when you would be otherwise playing Em9) for a\n little variety.\n"}

You only have to lift your pinky while\nplaying the B and move it two strings down for a second or two and then back up to the regular B and voila\nyou've played a B7sus.\nThroughout the song you can also slide a half-step up into the B before switching to the E which you'll hear\nthem do in the song quite a bit. So start on A# and slide one fret up into the B for a downstroke and then off\nto E.

I think D* is actually Dsus but I'm not sure.\n   F* is used in the chorus. I pay the F chord as a barre chord (see tab above)\n   and lift my first (barre) finger on alternate strums.\n   I guess you really have to listen to the record to get the  and\n    sections timed/played correctly."}
