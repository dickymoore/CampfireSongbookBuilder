"""Helper functions for working with JSONL cache files.

The application caches lyrics and chords on disk using the JSONL format.  Each
line of the cache file is a JSON object with at least three keys: ``artist``,
``title`` and either ``lyrics`` or ``chords`` depending on the cache.  These
helpers provide convenient functions to load, save and list entries.
