"""Fix mojibake (encoding issues) in JSONL cache files.

Some cached entries may be improperly encoded due to upstream source errors or
incorrect decoding when saving.  This utility reads each JSONL file in
``data/cache`` and attempts to reparse entries that fail to decode.  Lines
that still cannot be decoded are skipped.

Example usage::

    python fix_mojibake_in_cache.py
